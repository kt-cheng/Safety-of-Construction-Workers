# Safety-of-Construction

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Abstract

Site safety is an issue that needs to be scrutinized  in the field of construction, and one of the causes of  occupational accidents is unsafe behavior. In order to  research the reasons and solve them, coupled with the  boost of artificial intelligence in recent years, this  research aims at identifying whether the posture of the  construction worker is safe or not, and the purpose is to  reduce the mortality of the construction workers. The  real-time behavior of the construction worker is  captured and monitored by a drone, and the images are  transmitted through the network to the edge computing  device with almost synchronous efficiency. Using the  object detection model, YOLOv3, it can accurately find  the location of the construction worker. In order to  improve the accuracy of estimating, the high resolution-net is used to estimate the human pose.  Finally, the Long short-term memory model in deep  learning is used to solve the time-dependency  identification problem.
